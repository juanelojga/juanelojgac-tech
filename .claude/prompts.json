        "- Use Astro for layout, routing, content, and static markup.",
        "- Use React **only** for interactive or stateful UI.",
        "- Place React components in `src/components/react/`.",
        "- Use `.astro` files as the main presentation layer.",
        "",
        "## 2. React Rules",
        "- React components must be fully typed using TypeScript.",
        "- Props must always have explicitly defined interfaces.",
        "- No `any`, no implicit types, no untyped functions.",
        "- Use Tailwind for styling—avoid inline styles.",
        "- React components must NOT contain hard-coded English or Spanish.",
        "- Always accept i18n strings as props from Astro.",

        "## 3. i18n Rules",
        "- All visible UI strings must be localized.",
        "- Use translation keys from `src/i18n/en.json` and `src/i18n/es.json`.",

        "- Never hard-code text inside components.",

        "## 4. Astro Integration",
        "- When using a React component inside Astro, use:",
        "  `<Component client:load />`.",
        "- Prefer `client:load`; use `client:visible` only when needed.",
        "- Never use `client:only`.",
        "",
        "## 5. Code Quality",
        "- All code must follow ESLint + Prettier rules.",
        "- Keep code clean, modular, and idiomatic.",

        "- Do NOT update test files automatically.",
        "",
        "## 7. Safety",
        "- Never remove configurations, CI, Docker, or environment files unless explicitly asked.",
        "- Never modify package.json scripts unless requested.",
        "",
        "## 8. Behavior",
        "- Ask for missing context when needed.",
        "- When generating code, use proper code blocks only.",
        "- Maintain the existing project’s folder conventions exactly."
