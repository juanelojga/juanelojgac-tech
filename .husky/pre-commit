# Optional: Run Playwright tests before commit
# Uncomment the following lines to enable pre-commit testing
# This will run a quick smoke test on chromium only
# For full test suite, use CI/CD pipeline

# echo "Running Playwright smoke tests..."
# npm run test:e2e:chromium -- --grep "@smoke"

# If you want to run all tests before commit (slower):
# npm run test:e2e
